# Exercise 5: Solution And First Solver
# This tutorial contains the solution of Exercise-5 (Health Management System). We used simple files and some fundamental concepts of Python to accomplish this Exercise. Your answer or code may vary, but it should give the same output or result, so don't get bothered about it. 

# Instructions:
# Create a food log file for each client
# Create an exercise log file for each client.
# Ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
# Write a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, A message should display "What you want to log. Diet or Exercise"
# Use function


# def getdate():
#     import datetime
#     return datetime.datetime.now()


# Health Management System
# 3 clients - Harry, Rohan and Hammad

def getdate():
    import datetime
    return datetime.datetime.now()

# Total 6 files
# write a function that when executed takes as input client name
# One more function to retrieve exercise or food for any client
